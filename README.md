# RPG-character-library-php
 my RPG character library set up with PHP and SQl database

## How it works
1. start by setting up a SQl database online or localy
2. then run the PHP in a local enviroment

## How it works
1. all the data in the databse is for display purpose only there is not sensitive data in it
2. i have made the images used in the application myself either fully original ore mixing parts of other drwaings togher. please be respectfull towards that fact and dont use them for anything else then in the application without informing me first.
